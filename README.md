# Let's create an Angular Story book!

UIs are built from the ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù starting with basic components then progressively combined to assemble screens.

We keep one step at a time by following this Component driven approach. Storybook is a tool for UI development to showcase components that are being developed.

It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

Basically work in chunks! üòä

I'll show you how to setup Storybook in Angular, and configure couple useful addons that are shipped with Storybook to create a Style guide (Minimal Design systems). Interesting huh? RSVP now to reserve your spot.
